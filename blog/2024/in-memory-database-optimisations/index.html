First, affordable RAM sizes are not increasing significantly anymore (&gt; 2TB are extremely costly). Second, SSDs have achieved astonishing improvements (3.5 GBps) while costing only $500.</p> <p>Combining large main memory buffers with fast SSDs is an attractive alternative as the cost is much lower and performance can be nearly as good.</p> <h3>Umbra</h3> <p>Genuine in-memory performance on the cached working set, and transparent scaling beyond main memory where required.</p> <h3>Buffer Manger</h3> <p>Combines low overhead buffering with variable-size pages.</p> <p>Buffer Pool memory mangement</p> <p>Pointer Swizzling</p> <p>Versioned Latches</p> <p>Buffer-Managed Relations</p> <p>Recovery</p> <h3>Further Considerations</h3> <p>String Handling</p> <p>Statistics</p> <p>Compilation &amp; Execution</p> <h3>Related Work</h3> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Umbra can achieve in-memory performance if the entire dataset fits into RAM, while fully utilizing the available disk I/O bandwidth if the data has to be spilled to disk. Introduced a novel low overhead buffer manager that renders this kind of performance possible. Also investigated key adaptations to other components of an in-memory database system that are required for the transition to an SSD-based system.</p> <h3>Reference</h3> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NpRTD28S_5MU9M8kRlxBGWlktRf_c4fN/view?usp=drive_link" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NpRTD28S_5MU9M8kRlxBGWlktRf_c4fN/view?usp=drive_link</a></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4c8c11cf34b2" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
