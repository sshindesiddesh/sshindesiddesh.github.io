I'm a **Distributed Systems Engineer** passionate about solving real-world problems at scale, with expertise in performance optimizations and resilient architectures. Currently working at [Cohesity](https://www.cohesity.com/) on the Data Platform team, where I focus on building scalable distributed systems for data management and protection.

With over **6 years of experience** in software engineering, I've worked across the full spectrum of systems development - from embedded systems and mobile platforms to large-scale distributed architectures. My journey has taken me through companies like Qualcomm, Marvell Technology, and now Cohesity, where I've contributed to everything from mobile security features to IoT wireless communication systems.

I hold a **Master's in Computer Science** from Stony Brook University, where I was part of the [File Systems and Storage Lab (FSL)](http://www.fsl.cs.stonybrook.edu/) under [Prof. Erez Zadok](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/). My technical interests span distributed systems, performance optimization, storage systems, and scalable architectures.

When I'm not building systems, you can find me writing about technology on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sshindesiddesh), exploring the latest tech trends, or enjoying the outdoors through hiking and traveling.
